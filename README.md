Project Motivation

The following project will investigate the short term property market in the city of seattle also referred to as the Emerald city. To conduct this investigation, the analysis will follow the CRISP-DM process which stands for Cross Industry Process for Data Mining.

Based on the available data we will attempt to understand the following 
a) What are the trends in the listings and reviews over the years in the short term property market?
b) What specific locations and property types have the highest listings?
c) How have the prices changed over the years (nightly_prices,weekly_prices,monthly_prices)?
d) What is the price average in specific areas?
We will also model the nightly_price of listings in seattle
